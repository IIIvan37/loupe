/**
 * Fitness function for the project-state docs.
 *
 * `docs/STATUS.md` describes the PRESENT: where we are, and the single next
 * action. Left to good intentions it turns into an append-only log — a roadmap
 * row per step, a journal line per session, every resolved decision — and by
 * the time it is 300 lines nobody reads the three lines that matter. That is
 * not a hypothetical: this repo's STATUS.md reached ~700 lines before these
 * bounds landed.
 *
 * Anything that only accumulates is derivable elsewhere and does not belong
 * here: the session list is `ls docs/sessions/`, the history is `git log`,
 * the plans live in their own dated documents.
 *
 * These bounds are deliberately mechanical. Discipline is what already failed.
