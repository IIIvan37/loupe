# Session — 2026-07-04 — ui-workstation-clarity

User-driven UI clarity pass on the workstation, before resuming the roadmap.
Started from four observations: the right sidebar sat half-empty, saved loops
lived in the main column while markers lived in the sidebar (inconsistent), the
separation text dangled at the bottom, and the mix was hard to read. Three
refactors on one branch, each its own commit.

## Done

- **#1 — Mix legibility (`327eb30`).** The main « Mix » lane no longer stacks
  every stem as a translucent coloured overlay (4-stem mud + redundant with the
  per-stem lanes). It draws **one summed envelope** via the already-existing but
  unused pure `combineWaveforms`, weighting each stem by its **effective gain**
  so muting/soloing reshapes the mix live. `WaveformView` prop `mixLayers[]` →
  `mixWaveform?: Waveform`; `MixLayer` type + `.layer` CSS removed; `ShellStage`
  derives `mixWaveform` in a `useMemo`. New i18n id `waveform.mix-image`.
- **#2 — Saved loops → sidebar (`3a15946`).** Split the loop bar by nature: the
  **live A/B controls** (loop on/off, save, clear the current selection) stay
  inline as `LoopControls`; the **saved-loop library** becomes a « Boucles » tab
  beside « Repères » in the `AnalysisPanel`. A shared `EntryRow` renders both
  lists (seek/recall, rename, remove); marker list CSS classes renamed generic
  `entry*`. `loop-bar.{tsx,spec,module.css}` deleted → `loop-controls.*`. New ids
  `analysis.tab-loops`, `analysis.no-loops`.
- **#3 — Separation action + undetected caption (`f5251ff`).** Split the
  bottom-dangling separation section by lifecycle: the **« Séparer » action +
  progress + error** move to the **top of the column** (import moment) and step
  aside entirely once ready; the **« Non détectés » caption** moves into the
  **mixer gutter** as a new dumb `UndetectedStems`, sat under the headers it
  qualifies. `SeparationPanel` returns null when `ready`. New id
  `mixer.undetected` (old `separation.ready`/`separation.undetected` dropped).

Net effect vs the four observations: sidebar filled (Boucles tab), loops/markers
now consistent siblings, separation text relocated by lifecycle, mix reads as a
single reactive envelope.

## Not done / remaining

- **Browser verification of #2/#3** not run this session (user chose
  report + PR first); **PR #46 opened.** #1 was browser-verified by the user mid-session. #2 is
  structural + well covered by tests; #3's gutter caption needs a real
  separation with a masked (near-silent) stem to see live — the fake separator in
  tests returns present stems only, so the caption path is covered by the
  `UndetectedStems` unit spec, not integration.

## Decisions

- **Mix lane = summed envelope, not overlay** (confirmed with the user). The
  stems are the decomposition of the mix, so their gain-weighted sum ≈ the
  original waveform and muting carves it out — honest « what you hear ».
- **Sidebar is the navigation home**: revisitable libraries (markers, loops)
  live there as sibling tabs; live gestures (region editing) stay inline by the
  waveform. Loops got a **dedicated « Boucles » tab** (not a combined
  « Navigation » tab) — same pattern as the existing tabs.
- **Separation split by lifecycle**: pre-stems affordance (action/progress) at
  the top; post-stems fact (undetected) in the mixer gutter. The panel dissolves
  once the stems ARE the mixer.

## Gate status

- typecheck: **green**.
- tests (with coverage): **green — 537 passed / 60 files** (was 535; +
  `undetected-stems.spec`, loop-bar spec → loop-controls spec, analysis-panel
  loop tests).
- mutation (Stryker, local): **skipped — no `@app/core` change this session**
  (`combineWaveforms` already existed and is already covered by
  `waveform-mix.spec`). All changes are in the `packages/web` adapter.
- biome / sheriff / knip / jscpd: **green** — Sheriff « No issues », knip clean,
  jscpd **1.82 %** (< 2.5 % threshold). react-doctor + design gate clean.

## State to resume from

- **Single next action**: commit this report on
  `refactor/ui-workstation-clarity`, then `pnpm gate` → push → open the PR
  (bundles #1+#2+#3, one PR per the user's choice).
- Gotchas / half-done edits:
  - `CLAUDE.md` has an unrelated pre-session modification (`M CLAUDE.md`) — kept
    **out** of every commit this session; leave it for the user.
  - Shell integration specs recall a saved loop via a `savedLoop(name)` helper
    (negative-lookahead regex) because the recall button's accessible name is
    « time-range + name » and the sibling rename/remove buttons share the name.
  - The « Boucles » tab panel is unmounted until selected — integration tests
    must `openLoops(user)` before asserting on saved-loop rows.
