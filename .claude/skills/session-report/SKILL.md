description: Close a work step with a resumable session report. Use at the end of every step/PR so a fresh session can pick up exactly where this one left off. Updates the canonical docs/STATUS.md and appends a dated report under docs/sessions/.

# Session report (close a work step)

Produce the artifacts that let a new session resume with zero context loss. Run
this at the end of each step/PR, before stopping.

## 1. Gather the real state (don't guess)

```
date +%F                       # the report's date / filename prefix
git branch --show-current
git status --short
```

Then run the quality gate and record the result:

- `pnpm gate` (typecheck + biome + arch + design + react + tests with coverage
  + knip + jscpd).
- **Mutation testing locally (Stryker), scoped to the diff.** If the step
  touched `@app/core` (the mutated scope), run `pnpm test:mutation:diff` — it
  mutates only the core modules the branch touches — and report the score in
  the gate section. Surviving mutants must be caught **before** the PR, while
  the code is fresh. The FULL run (`pnpm test:mutation`) is CI's post-merge
  job and stays authoritative — never claim its score locally. Skip only when
  the step touched no mutated package (say so). One heavy run at a time (no
  Stryker concurrent with `gate` or a full suite — CPU starvation fails tests).
- **SonarCloud results** — `pnpm sonar` (no token, no scanner: it reads the
  analysis CI already ran, for this branch's PR, else `main`). Record the
  quality-gate status and any issue the PR introduced. Sonar sees rules the
  local detectors don't (cognitive complexity, a11y, Python), so a green `gate`
  is not evidence of a clean Sonar report. Analysis lands ~5 min after the
  push — if it says "no analysis yet", wait rather than skip. A false positive
  is triaged in `sonar-project.properties` (config-as-code, travels with the
  PR), never resolved in the web UI.
- Don't fabricate a green check — report failures honestly.
- **Module watch** (rule of three): does a prefix/concept now appear >= 3 times
  in the flat `core/src/domain`? does a use-case + port serve a single cluster?
  If yes, note it under "Decisions" as a pending extraction — or extract before
  closing (`/new-feature-hexa` 4bis). (`pnpm modules:hint` will point at
  candidates once lot TS.5 lands.)

## 2. Append a dated session report

- Copy `docs/sessions/_TEMPLATE.md` to `docs/sessions/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`
  (slug = the step). Never overwrite an existing report — history is append-only.
- Fill every section honestly: Done, Not done / remaining, Decisions, Gate status
  (with the results from step 1), State to resume from.
- "State to resume from" must name the SINGLE next action and any gotchas /
  half-done edits.
- **Decisions is a log, not an explanation.** If the step changed a boundary, an
  invariant or the toolchain, write the reasoning once as an ADR under
  `docs/adr/` (once lot TS.3 sets the practice up) and link it from this
  section. Never restate the why in both places — a report is read to resume,
  an ADR is read months later by someone about to undo the constraint. Most
  steps need no ADR.

## 3. Roll the window

`docs/sessions/` keeps only the recent reports scannable. If the folder grows
past ~5 active reports, `git mv` the oldest into `docs/sessions/archive/`
(create it on first use). Nothing is deleted — the working set just stays
scannable.

## 4. Rewrite the canonical STATUS — inside the PR, merge-invariantly

`docs/STATUS.md` is a **snapshot of the present, not a log**: only the current
step detailed, one "Historique" line per past step (detail lives in
`docs/sessions/`). Rewrite it, don't append:

- **Where we are** — phase, step, packages. Replace the old text.
- **Next action** — the SINGLE next thing. Replace it.
- **Write it merge-invariantly.** STATUS (and the roadmap's Suivi table) ship
  inside the PR but are read on `main` after the merge — any fact that flips
  at merge time is born stale. Name the step and its PR ("step N, delivered by
  PR #NN" is true before and after), never the feature branch or the PR's
  lifecycle state ("PR opening", "merge on green CI"); make the next action
  the one that follows the merge. Only the dated report keeps pre-merge
  phrasing (it describes a past).
- **Open questions** — only what is genuinely undecided; delete each one when
  resolved.

If two parallel slices both touch STATUS, the conflict is trivial by
construction (a snapshot, one current step per zone) — resolve it by keeping
both facts, never by moving STATUS back out of the PRs.

## 5. Keep memory in sync (optional, if the plan shifted)

If a durable cross-session decision changed (an invariant, a resolved open
question, a scope change), capture it. Don't duplicate the whole report — just the
durable decision.

## 6. Commit the report + STATUS on the feature branch — BEFORE the PR

The dated report and the STATUS/Suivi update describe the work the PR
contains, so they ship **inside** the PR — never as a separate post-merge
commit on `main`.

- Commit them on the **feature branch**, before `gh pr create`. Order per
  feature: feature commits → this report commit → `pnpm gate` → push → open
  PR → merge.
- Phrase the **dated report** for the **pre-merge** state ("PR #N opened",
  branch still current) — not as if it were already merged. STATUS is the
  opposite (see step 4): merge-invariant, because it lives on `main`.
- The doc-only-direct-to-`main` exception (see the `block-commit-on-main` hook)
  is only for a **standalone** report not tied to a code PR; a report that
  accompanies code goes in that code's PR.

## Output

End with a 3-line summary to the user: what's done, the next action, and the
report path.
